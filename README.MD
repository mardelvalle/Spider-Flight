I find that whenever I go to search for flights I can never quite get the search results I want. And going to my email for updates can be a pain. Honestly flights are one of those searches that just feels yucky.

This is what this app is meant to help to address. The goal of this webcrawler is to become a chrome extension. Set it up with the destinations you want to look into and the extension will periodically search and give you feedback so that it can give you better results.

Currently the app does a basical crawler call. Next I would like to add a ui component in the browser.

This project is to help gain for node/webcrawler experience while making something that I can use myself!
